  <h1><a href="index.html" id="heading">Bitcoin Zero-Fee Priority Calculator</a></h1>
  <h3>
    What is this?
  </h3>
  <p>
    It's a tool that calculates the Priority value for zero-fee transactions. It'll give you an estimate for 
    how long it will take to have enough Priority to qualify for a free transaction.<br><br>
  </p>
  <h3>
    What is Transaction Priority?
  </h3>
  <p>Transactions generally get included in a block for one of two reasons:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Transaction Fee</li>
    <li>Transaction Priority</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The transaction fee is the main criteria, but if there is no fee, 
    the transactions needs to have a high enough Priority:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Priority is related to the 'age' of the bitcoins you are spending.</li>
    <li>The older the bitcoins (i.e. number of confirmations), the higher the priority.</li>
    <li>The larger the number of bitcoins, and the smaller the transaction size, the higher the priority.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    As an example, if you are sending a 1 BTC transaction, the previous transaction needs to be 
    roughly 1 day old to have sufficient priority.
  </p>
  <p> See <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_fees#Technical_info">here</a> 
    for details on how priority is computed.<br><br></p>

  <h3>How much fee should I pay for my transaction?</h3>
  <p>
    Miners typically sort transactions according to Fee Rate (fee per unit transaction size)
    and include higher fee rate transactions until their maximum block size is reached, or the transaction is 
    below the minimum fee rate. As of Nov 2014 the min fee rate is typically 0.00001000 BTC per kB.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the future, Bitcoin clients will be able to tell you the optimal fee for getting confirmations, but for now
    they're mostly hardcoded with respect to the min fee rate.
